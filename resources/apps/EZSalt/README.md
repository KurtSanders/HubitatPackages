* In the Hubitat devices view, add a new Hubitat virtual device and specify this custom device driver.  
* Add your information to the new device preference fields.  
   * Must have an [EZsalt Sensor](https://www.ezsalt.com/for-users) installed and activated (Home WiFi) on the monitored brine salt tank.
